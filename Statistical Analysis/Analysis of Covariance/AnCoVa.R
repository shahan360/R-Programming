We use Regression analysis to create models which describe 
the effect of variation in predictor variables on the response variable. 
Sometimes, if we have a categorical variable with values like Yes/No or Male/Female etc. 
The simple regression analysis gives multiple results for each value of the categorical variable. 
In such scenario, we can study the effect of the categorical variable by using it along with the 
predictor variable and comparing the regression lines for each level of the categorical variable. 
Such an analysis is termed as Analysis of Covariance also called as ANCOVA.

Example
Consider the R built in data set mtcars. In it we observer that the field 'am' 
represents the type of transmission (auto or manual). 
It is a categorical variable with values 0 and 1. The miles per gallon value(mpg) 
of a car can also depend on it besides the value of horse power('hp').

We study the effect of the value of 'am' on the regression between 'mpg' and 'hp'. 
It is done by using the aov() function followed by the anova() function to compare the multiple regressions.

Input Data
Create a data frame containing the fields 'mpg', 'hp' and 'am' from the data set mtcars. 
Here we take 'mpg' as the response variable, 'hp' as the predictor variable and 'am' as the categorical variable.
"

input <- mtcars[,c("am","mpg","hp")]
print(head(input))

"
ANCOVA Analysis
We create a regression model taking 'hp' as the predictor variable and 'mpg' 
as the response variable taking into account the interaction between 'am' and 'hp'.
"
#Model with interaction between categorical variable and predictor variable

# Get the dataset.
input <- mtcars
#Create a regression model
model <- aov(mpg ~ hp*am, data = input) # hp*am is the interaction term
print(summary(model))

"
This result shows that both horse power and transmission type 
has significant effect on miles per gallon as the p value in 
both cases is less than 0.05. But the interaction between 
these two variables is not significant as the p-value is more than 0.05.
"

#Model without interaction between categorical variable and predictor variable
#Get the dataset.
input <- mtcars
#Create a regression model
model <- aov(mpg ~ hp + am, data = input) # hp + am is the interaction term
print(summary(model))

"
This result shows that both horse power and transmission type 
has significant effect on miles per gallon as the p value 
in both cases is less than 0.05.
"

#Comparing two models
"
Now we can compare the two models to conclude if the 
interaction of the variables is truly in-significant. 
For this we use the anova() function.
"
# Get the dataset.
input <- mtcars

# Create the regression models.
result1 <- aov(mpg~hp*am,data = input)
result2 <- aov(mpg~hp+am,data = input)

# Compare the two models.
print(anova(result1,result2))

"
As the p-value is greater than 0.05 
we conclude that the interaction between 
horse power and transmission type is not significant. 
So the mileage per gallon will depend in a similar manner 
on the horse power of the car in both auto and manual transmission mode.
