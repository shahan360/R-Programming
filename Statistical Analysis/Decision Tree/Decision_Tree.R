Decision tree is a graph to represent choices and their results 
in form of a tree. The nodes in the graph represent an event or 
choice and the edges of the graph represent the decision rules 
or conditions. It is mostly used in Machine Learning and Data Mining 
applications using R.

Examples of use of decision tress is − predicting an email as spam or 
not spam, predicting of a tumor is cancerous or predicting a loan as a 
good or bad credit risk based on the factors in each of these. Generally, 
a model is created with observed data also called training data. Then a set 
of validation data is used to verify and improve the model. R has packages 
which are used to create and visualize decision trees. For new set of predictor 
variable, we use this model to arrive at a decision on the category (yes/No, spam/not spam) 
of the data.

The R package 'party' is used to create decision trees.
"

#Install R Package
# install.packages("party")

"
The package 'party' has the function ctree() 
which is used to create and analyze decison tree.

Syntax
The basic syntax for creating a decision tree in R is −

ctree(formula, data)

Following is the description of the parameters used −

formula is a formula describing the predictor and response variables.

data is the name of the data set used.

Input Data
We will use the R in-built data set named readingSkills to create a decision tree. 
It describes the score of someone's readingSkills if we know the variables 'age','shoesize','score' 
and whether the person is a native speaker or not.
"

# Load the party package. It will automatically load other
# dependent packages.
library(party)

# Print some records from data set readingSkills.
print(head(readingSkills))

# Load the party package. It will automatically load other
# dependent packages.
library(party)

# Create the input data frame.
input.dat <- readingSkills[c(1:105),]

# Give the chart file a name.
png(file = "decision_tree.png")

# Create the tree.
output.tree <- ctree(nativeSpeaker ~ age + shoeSize + score, data = input.dat)

# Plot the tree.
plot(output.tree)

# Save the file.
dev.off()

"
Conclusion
From the decision tree shown above we can conclude 
that anyone whose readingSkills score is less than 38.3 
and age is more than 6 is not a native Speaker.
