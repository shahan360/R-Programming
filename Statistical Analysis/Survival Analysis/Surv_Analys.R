Survival analysis deals with predicting the time when a specific event is going to occur. 
It is also known as failure time analysis or analysis of time to death. 
For example predicting the number of days a person with cancer will survive or 
predicting the time when a mechanical system is going to fail.

The R package named survival is used to carry out survival analysis. 
This package contains the function Surv() which takes the input data 
as a R formula and creates a survival object among the chosen variables 
for analysis. Then we use the function survfit() to create a plot for 
the analysis.

# Install R Package
# install.packages("survival")

Syntax
The basic syntax for creating survival analysis in R is −

Surv(time,event)
survfit(formula)
Following is the description of the parameters used −

time is the follow up time until the event occurs.

event indicates the status of occurrence of the expected event.

formula is the relationship between the predictor variables.

Example
We will consider the data set named 'pbc' present in the 
survival packages installed above. It describes the survival 
data points about people affected with primary biliary cirrhosis 
(PBC) of the liver. Among the many columns present in the data 
set we are primarily concerned with the fields 'time' and 'status'. 
Time represents the number of days between registration of the patient 
and earlier of the event between the patient receiving a liver transplant 
or death of the patient.

# Remove the lazy-load database associated with the survival package
file.remove(system.file("data/Rdata.rdb", package="survival"))

# Reinstall the survival package
install.packages("survival")

# Load the library again
library("survival")

# Check if the issue persists
print(head(pbc))

#Applying the Surv() and survfit() functions to the data set
# Load the library.
library("survival")

# Create the survival object. 
survfit(Surv(pbc$time,pbc$status == 2)~1)

# Give the chart file a name.
png(file = "survival.png")

# Plot the graph. 
plot(survfit(Surv(pbc$time,pbc$status == 2)~1))

# Save the file.
dev.off()

"The trend in the attached graph helps us predicting the 
probability of survival at the end of a certain number of days."
