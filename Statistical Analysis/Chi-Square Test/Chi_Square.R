Chi-Square test is a statistical method to determine if 
two categorical variables have a significant correlation 
between them. Both those variables should be from same population 
and they should be categorical like − Yes/No, Male/Female, Red/Green etc.

For example, we can build a data set with observations on people's 
ice-cream buying pattern and try to correlate the gender of a person 
with the flavor of the ice-cream they prefer. If a correlation is found 
we can plan for appropriate stock of flavors by knowing the number of 
gender of people visiting.

Syntax
The function used for performing chi-Square test is chisq.test().

The basic syntax for creating a chi-square test in R is −

chisq.test(data)
Following is the description of the parameters used −

data is the data in form of a table containing the count 
value of the variables in the observation.

We will take the Cars93 data in the 'MASS' library 
which represents the sales of different models of 
car in the year 1993.
"

# Load the MASS library
library("MASS")
print(str(Cars93))

"
The above result shows the dataset has many 
Factor variables which can be considered as 
categorical variables. For our model we will 
consider the variables 'AirBags' and 'Type'. 
Here we aim to find out any significant correlation 
between the types of car sold and the type of Air bags 
it has. If correlation is observed we can estimate which 
types of cars can sell better with what types of air bags.
"

# Load the library.
library("MASS")

# Create a data frame from the main data set.
car.data <- data.frame(Cars93$AirBags, Cars93$Type)

# Create a table with the needed variables.
car.data = table(Cars93$AirBags, Cars93$Type) 
print(car.data)

# Perform the Chi-Square test.
print(chisq.test(car.data))

"
Conclusion
The result shows the p-value of less than 
0.05 which indicates a string correlation.
