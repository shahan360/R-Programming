Poisson Regression involves regression models in which 
the response variable is in the form of counts and 
not fractional numbers. For example, the count of number 
of births or number of wins in a football match series. 
Also the values of the response variables follow a Poisson distribution.

The general mathematical equation for Poisson regression is −

log(y) = a + b1x1 + b2x2 + bnxn.....
Following is the description of the parameters used −

y is the response variable.

a and b are the numeric coefficients.

x is the predictor variable.

The function used to create the Poisson regression model is the glm() function.

Syntax
The basic syntax for glm() function in Poisson regression is −

glm(formula,data,family)
Following is the description of the parameters used in above functions −

formula is the symbol presenting the relationship between the variables.

data is the data set giving the values of these variables.

family is R object to specify the details of the model. 
It's value is 'Poisson' for Logistic Regression.

Example
We have the in-built data set 'warpbreaks' which describes 
the effect of wool type (A or B) and tension (low, medium or high) 
on the number of warp breaks per loom. Let's consider 'breaks' as 
the response variable which is a count of number of breaks. 
The wool 'type' and 'tension' are taken as predictor variables.
"

#Input data
input <- warpbreaks
print(head(input))

#Create Poisson regression model
model <- glm(formula = breaks ~ wool+tension, data = input, family = poisson)
print(summary(model))

"
In the summary we look for the p-value in the last column 
to be less than 0.05 to consider an impact of the predictor 
variable on the response variable. As seen the wooltype B 
having tension type M and H have impact on the count of breaks.
