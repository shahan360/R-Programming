Time series is a series of data points in which each data point is associated with a timestamp. 
A simple example is the price of a stock in the stock market at different points of time on a given day. 
Another example is the amount of rainfall in a region at different months of the year. R language uses many 
functions to create, manipulate and plot the time series data. The data for the time series is stored in an 
R object called time-series object. It is also a R data object like a vector or data frame.

The time series object is created by using the ts() function.

Syntax
The basic syntax for ts() function in time series analysis is −

timeseries.object.name <-  ts(data, start, end, frequency)
Following is the description of the parameters used −

data is a vector or matrix containing the values used in the time series.

start specifies the start time for the first observation in time series.

end specifies the end time for the last observation in time series.

frequency specifies the number of observations per unit time.

Except the parameter 'data' all other parameters are optional.

Example
Consider the annual rainfall details at a place 
starting from January 2012. We create an R time series 
object for a period of 12 months and plot it.
'


# Get the data points in form of a R vector.
rainfall <- c(799,1174.8,865.1,1334.6,635.4,918.5,685.5,998.6,784.2,985,882.8,1071)

# Create a time series object.
rainfall.timeseries <- ts(rainfall, start = c(2012, 1), end = c(2012, 12), frequency = 12)

# Print the time series object.
print(rainfall.timeseries)

#Give the chart file a name
png(file = "rainfall.png")

# Plot the time series data.
plot(rainfall.timeseries, main = "Rainfall Time Series", ylab = "Rainfall", xlab = "Month")

# Save the file.
dev.off()

Different Time Intervals
The value of the frequency parameter in the ts() function decides 
the time intervals at which the data points are measured. 
A value of 12 indicates that the time series is for 12 months. 
Other values and its meaning is as below −

frequency = 12 pegs the data points for every month of a year.

frequency = 4 pegs the data points for every quarter of a year.

frequency = 6 pegs the data points for every 10 minutes of an hour.

frequency = 24*6 pegs the data points for every 10 minutes of a day.
