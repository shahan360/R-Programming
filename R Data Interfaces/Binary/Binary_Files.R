"R has two functions WriteBin() and readBin() to create and read binary files.

Syntax
writeBin(object, con)
readBin(con, what, n )

con is the connection object to read or write the binary file.

object is the binary file which to be written.

what is the mode like character, integer etc. representing the bytes to be read.

n is the number of bytes to read from the binary file

#Writing the Binary File
# Read the "mtcars" data frame as a csv file and store only the columns "cyl", "am" and "gear".
write.table(mtcars, file = "mtcars.csv",row.names = FALSE, na = "", col.names = TRUE, sep = ",")

# Store 5 records from the csv file as a new data frame.
new.mtcars <- read.table("mtcars.csv",sep = ",",header = TRUE,nrows = 5)

# Create a connection object to write the binary file using mode "wb".
write.filename = file("binmtcars.dat", "wb")

# Write the column names of the data frame to the connection object.
writeBin(colnames(new.mtcars), write.filename)

# Write the records in each of the column to the file.
writeBin(c(new.mtcars$cyl,new.mtcars$am,new.mtcars$gear), write.filename)

# Close the file for writing so that it can be read by other program.
close(write.filename)

#Reading the Binary File
# Create a connection object to read the file in binary mode using "rb".
read.filename <- file("binmtcars.dat", "rb")

# First read the column names. n = 3 as we have 3 columns.
column.names <- readBin(read.filename, character(),  n = 3)

# Next read the column values. n = 18 as we have 3 column names and 15 values.
read.filename <- file("binmtcars.dat", "rb")
bindata <- readBin(read.filename, integer(),  n = 18)

# Print the data.
print(bindata)

# Read the values from 4th byte to 8th byte which represents "cyl".
cyldata = bindata[4:8]
print(cyldata)

# Read the values form 9th byte to 13th byte which represents "am".
amdata = bindata[9:13]
print(amdata)

# Read the values form 9th byte to 13th byte which represents "gear".
geardata = bindata[14:18]
print(geardata)

# Combine all the read values to a dat frame.
finaldata = cbind(cyldata, amdata, geardata)
colnames(finaldata) = column.names
print(finaldata)
